- ⚡ Fun fact: Although I have always been enthusiastic about emerging technologies, I am new to the technical aspects of working directly with AI models.  I have made a decision to jump into this space with both feet as I wholeheartedly believe in the transformative potential for these technologies to overcome previouslt intractable problems.
